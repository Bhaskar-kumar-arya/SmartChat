# Frontend Bug Audit Tracker

Single source of truth. Read [`README.md`](./README.md) for the session protocol
and the frontend bug-class checklist. Update the status table and append findings
here. Fix phase → [`FIX_PLAN.md`](./FIX_PLAN.md) (created once auditing is far
enough along).

Statuses: `TODO` · `IN PROGRESS` · `DONE (<n> findings)` · `BLOCKED`

Audited: `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `context/ContributionContext.tsx`, `context/APIContext.tsx`,
`hooks/useContributions.ts`, `utils/whenCondition.ts`, `utils/contributionUtils.tsx`.

### [F2-01] med — src/renderer/src/App.tsx:89
**What:** `handleSetSyncFullHistory` sets `isRegeneratingQr = true`, clears the QR, then
`await api.setSyncFullHistory(full)` with no `try/catch/finally`, and the `onClick` callers
don't `.catch`.
**Why it's a bug:** on the QR screen, clicking a sync-mode option calls this. If the IPC call
rejects (or just never triggers a fresh `onWaQr` because the backend errored), `isRegeneratingQr`
is never reset and `qr` stays `null`, so the QR pane is stuck on the "Generating new QR code..."
spinner forever — the user can't link the device without restarting the app. Also produces an
unhandled promise rejection.
**Fix idea:** wrap in `try { ... } finally { }` (or reset `isRegeneratingQr` on the next
`onWaQr`), and have the backend guarantee a QR re-emit; surface an error toast on reject.
**Status:** open

### [F2-02] med — src/renderer/src/context/ContributionContext.tsx:15-38
**What:** the effect fires `api.getContributions().then(setSnapshot)` and *then* registers
`api.onContributionsUpdated(setSnapshot)`. The initial fetch is not cancelled/superseded when an
update event arrives first.
**Why it's a bug:** if a contribution registry change is pushed from main between effect-mount and
the `getContributions()` promise resolving (plugin activating during startup), the update event
lands first and sets the fresh snapshot, then the slower initial fetch resolves with the older
snapshot and clobbers it. The UI then shows stale contributions (missing menu items / panels)
until the next update. `mounted` guards unmount but not this ordering.
**Fix idea:** track whether an update has already been applied (or a request seq) and ignore the
initial `.then` if so; or subscribe before fetching and treat the fetch as lowest priority.
**Status:** open

### [F2-03] low — src/renderer/src/App.tsx:27-33
**What:** initial `api.getSyncFullHistory().then((full) => setSyncFullHistory(full))` effect has
no mounted/abort guard.
**Why it's a bug:** if `App` unmounts before the IPC resolves (fast transition to `ready`, or
StrictMode remount in dev), `setSyncFullHistory` runs after unmount → React warning; harmless in
prod but inconsistent with the guarded pattern used elsewhere.
**Fix idea:** add a `let alive = true` flag with cleanup, matching `ContributionContext`.
**Status:** open

### [F2-04] low — src/renderer/src/App.tsx:43-51, 132-316
**What:** `onWaConnected` can set `appState = 'connected'` (when `data.isCatchup`), but the render
has branches only for `'ready'`, `'syncing'`, `'qr'`, and an else. `'connected'` falls into the
else branch.
**Why it's a bug:** during a catch-up reconnect the setup card shows the generic init spinner with
whatever text `syncStatus` currently holds (often the stale "Initializing connection..." or a
leftover sync status), which misrepresents the state to the user.
**Fix idea:** give `'connected'` its own copy ("Reconnecting / catching up…") or map it to the
`'syncing'` visual.
**Status:** open

### [F2-05] low — src/renderer/src/utils/contributionUtils.tsx:27-31
**What:** `subMenu: sub.subMenu ? mapSubMenuItems(...) : undefined` and the matching
`onClick: sub.subMenu ? undefined : ...`. An empty array `sub.subMenu === []` is truthy.
**Why it's a bug:** a plugin that declares `subMenu: []` (or one whose children all get filtered
out upstream) produces a menu entry with an empty submenu and no `onClick` — a dead, unclickable
item with a hover arrow.
**Fix idea:** check `sub.subMenu && sub.subMenu.length > 0`.
**Status:** open

### [F2-06] low — src/renderer/src/hooks/useContributions.ts:7-9
**What:** on the "no contributions for this slot" path the hook returns a freshly-allocated `[]`
literal every render.
**Why it's a bug:** consumers that put the result in a `useEffect`/`useMemo` dependency array (or
pass it as a prop to a memoized child) see a new reference every render → effect re-runs / child
re-renders on every parent render while the slot is empty (the common case).
**Fix idea:** return a module-level frozen `EMPTY: [] as const` for the empty path.
**Status:** open

### [F2-07] low — src/renderer/src/utils/whenCondition.ts:42-45
**What:** `neq` is `ctxValue !== value`; when `condition.field` is absent from the context,
`ctxValue` is `undefined` and the comparison is true.
**Why it's a bug:** a `{ field: 'x', op: 'neq', value: 'foo' }` gate is meant to hide a
contribution when `x === 'foo'`, but it also *passes* (shows it) for any context that simply
lacks `x` — likely not the plugin author's intent, and asymmetric with `eq`.
**Fix idea:** treat a missing field as a non-match for `neq`/`nin` (require `condition.field in
context`), or document the semantics explicitly.
**Status:** open
